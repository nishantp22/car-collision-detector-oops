# Car Collision Detector Using Objective Oriented Programming
This is my first github repository which I created while learning OOPs in C++<br>
A class named Car has been created which has attributes : model, make, year of manufacture, (x,y,z) coordinates and (x,y,z) componants of speed.<br>
The class also has the following methods:<br>
        1. A Constructor which would initialise the values of all the attributes through inputs provided by the user.<br>
        2. menu() : The user will be asked to input a number and based on the input, various other methods will be called.<br>
                    (notice that in every case in the switch case statement of method menu(), there is a statement op=x,where op is a global/static variable. This means that the value of op is equal to the operation user
                    wants to perform for that particular car. 
                    for return value of menu(): the method menu() returns either -1, when there is no involvement of two cars in a method, or returns 
                    the index of the 2nd car based on user's input, if the method involves two cars. We will use the op value and the return value in the main
                    function, as required)<br>
        3. printCurrentData() : This will print the data currently stored in all the attributes.<br>
        4. accelerate(): This will increase the x,y,z componants of speed based on the inputs provided by the user.<br>
        5. decelerate() : This will decrease the x,y,z componants of speed based on the inputs provided by the user.<br>
        6. move() : This will increment the current x,y,z coordinatess by the current x,y,z componants of speed.<br>
        7. distanceBetweenCars() : This method calculates the distance between two cars. It takes another Car object as an argument.<br>
        8. detectCollision() : This method will take another Car object as input and check if the self car and the car passed as argument have collided or not.<br>
        9. timeToCollision() : This method will print whether the two cars will collide in the future based on their current positions and velocities
                               and if they collide, the method will also print the time before collison and the distance of collision point from the car
                               passed as argument.<br>
<br>                               
We first take an input from the user about the number of cars present. Then we store all the cars in a vector of cars. Then we ask the user whether he wants to analyse any one of the cars(like increase its speed, move, or check collision with another car). The user can input 0 or 1 at this stage : <br>
1. If the user inputs 1, we ask the user about the car he wants to analyse(each car has a number from 1 to n, the user has to provide that number as input). Then the menu() method is called for that particular car and user has to select a choice from the menu. Then the user selects a choice and op is set to that particular choice and the menu() returns a value. Finally, based on the op value and returned value of menu(), operations are performed on one/two cars<br>
2. If the user inputs 0, we terminate the loop and the execution of program is completed. <br>
<br>
The approach used to check whether the two cars will collide or not is based on their relative posiitons and relative velocity :<br> 
       1. If their relative posiiton is zero, then they have already collided.<br>
       2. If their relative position is non-zero, but their relative velocity is zero, then they can never collide<br>
       3. If both the relative position and the relative velocitites are non zero, and the the angle between them is pi radians, then they will collide, else they
          will not collide(for any two vectors A and B, if theta is the angle between them, then by using cos(theta)=A.B/|A||B|,if theta is pi i.e if relative position of one car wrt other is anti parallel to relative velocity of
          that car wrt the other car, then A.B=-|A||B|)<br>
<br>
Assumptions :<br>
      1. The cars are moving uniformly, in a straight line while checking the time of collision i.e. They will not accelerate or change direction till the time of collision.<br>
      2. The user always provides valid inputs, wherever asked.<br>
      <br>
(PS-I was also thinking of incorporating inheritance, probably making a derived class named SpecialCar which would have extra parameters such as power value which would be the time in seconds from that particular instant till which the car would be able to pass through any other car, to avoid collisions. But I could not implement the approach as I was not sure on how to use the function `timeTillCollision` in that case where there are two objects of different classes.)
